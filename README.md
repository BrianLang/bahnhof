The goal of bahnhof is to proved a collection of tools which facilitate my personal
developer workflow. The name Bahnhof comes from "Brian's Helper Functions", which
is abbreviated "bhf". Bhf is the abbreviation for the German word "Bahnhof", which means 
"train station" in English.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bahnhof like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github()
```
