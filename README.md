The goal of bahnhof is to proved a collection of tools which facilitate my personal
developer workflow. The name Bahnhof comes from "Brian's Helper Functions", which
is abbreviated "bhf". Bhf is the abbreviation for the German word "Bahnhof", which means 
"train station" in English. Since I always go to the train station is where you go first if I want to go anywhere, I think the metaphor works. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of bahnhof like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github( "BrianLang/bahnhof")
```
